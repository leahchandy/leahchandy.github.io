## Chronic Kidney Disease Project - Progress Report 1: [Progress Report 1](ckd_project.html)
This project aims to predict whether or not 400 patients have chronic kidney disease.
Research Statement: The most influential predictors of chronic kidney disease are diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and anemia.

Progress Report 1 goes over:
- dataset information
- variable information
- imputation of missing values
- data visualization of the predictors in the research statement

## Chronic Kidney Disease Project - Progress Report 2: [Progress Report 2](progress_report_2.html)
The training set contains 300 records, and the test set contains 100 records. 

Progress Report 2 goes over:
- overall dataset information
- variable information
- information for both training and test sets:
-> imputation of missing values 
-> data visualization of the predictors in the research statement
-> logistic regression of all the predictors (including a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC) 
-> logistic regression of the most influential predictors in the all-predictor regression (including a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC)
-> logistic regression of the predictors in the research statement (including a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC)

next steps:
- figuring out how to prevent overfitting
