## Chronic Kidney Disease Project - Progress Report 1: [Progress Report 1](ckd_project.html)
This project aims to predict whether or not 400 patients have chronic kidney disease.
Research Statement: The most influential predictors of chronic kidney disease are diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and anemia.

Progress Report 1 goes over:
- dataset information
- variable information
- imputation of missing values
- data visualization of the predictors in the research statement

## Chronic Kidney Disease Project - Progress Report 2: [Progress Report 2](progress_report_2.html)
The training set contains 300 records, and the test set contains 100 records. 

Progress Report 2 goes over:
- overall dataset information
- variable information
- information for both training and test sets:
  * imputation of missing values 
  * data visualization of the predictors in the research statement
  * logistic regression of all the predictors (including a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC for the test set) 
  * logistic regression of the most influential predictors in the all-predictor regression (including a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC for the test set)
  * logistic regression of the predictors in the research statement (including a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC for the test set)

next steps:
- figuring out how to prevent overfitting

## Chronic Kidney Disease Project - Final Project: [Final Project](final_ckd_data.html)
Final Project goes over:
- everything in Progress Reports 1 and 2
- includes centering and scaling of continuous variables
- defining reference groups for the categorical variables 
- fixing graphs
